# Guidelines

Here are some guidelines for using open source tools for ethical hacking:

<ol>
  <li>Bug bounties are not a license to hack indiscriminately. Stay withing your scope and safe harbour.</li>

  <li>Ensure you have a strong understanding of the open source tools being used and their impact.</li>

  <li>Always obtain written permission from the owner of the target system before testing.</li>

  <li>Never go beyond the scope of the agreement.</li>

  <li>Be professional in your approach.</li>
</ol>

Here are some examples of websites that offer bug bounty programs for ethical hackers to test their skills:
